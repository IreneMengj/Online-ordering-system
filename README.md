# Online ordering system
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>  

DeliverEase is an online food ordering system built as a reference to Black Horse Programmer's "Regie Takeaway" tutorial on Bilibili. It is developed using the Spring Boot + MybatisPlus + MySQL technology stack. The tutorial video is cited in the reference section.    

DeliverEase is an online food ordering software product, which includes two parts: system management background and mobile application. The system management background is designed for internal staff of catering enterprises, enabling them to efficiently manage and maintain dishes, packages, and restaurant orders. On the other hand, the mobile application is aimed at consumers, providing them with the ability to browse dishes, add items to their shopping carts, and place orders conveniently through their mobile devices.  

Compared to the original tutorial, I expanded the functionality by introducing batch processing for dish and setmeal management, features that were not included in the original tutorial. Additionally, I created a comprehensive set of functions for order details, which were not present in the original tutorial. Moreover, in the mobile application, I added the capability for users to view their own orders and implemented the user logout functionality.  

Furthermore, to make the project universally accessible in the Dublin area, I also converted the original Chinese pages into English, ensuring broader usability and ease of navigation for English-speaking users.   

The project is divided into three phases:
- The first phase mainly realizes the development of the system management background.
- The second phase mainly realizes the development of mobile applications.
- The third phase is mainly to optimize and upgrade the system to improve the access performance of the system.
